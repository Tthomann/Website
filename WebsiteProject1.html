			<p>Made up of 6,852 islands that stretch across the coast of East Asia, Japan is an amazing place to go and 
explore. Although most of the land in Japan is unhabitable do to being too mountainous and forested, the 
countryside and city life make Japan a very interesting place to go. It also has 108 active volcanoes 
and is very prone to tsunamis caused by the earthquakes that Japan gets. There are many other interesting 
qualities that belong only to Japan.</p>
