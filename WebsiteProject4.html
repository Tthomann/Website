			<p>Nearly 100 percent of the population in Japan speak Japanese as their first language, to no surprise. 
The language is a system of honorifics reflecting the nature of Japanese life. Instead of using the English
Alphabet as their form of writing, the use language characters such as Kanji, and Katakana. Japanese schools
also require students to learn English as a secondary language, though most citizens of Japan get nervous 
or embarresed when trying to talk to english foreginers.</p>
